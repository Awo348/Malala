            Right from when I was a teenager, I read her book and I was inspired
            by how focused and smart she is. I got interested in her empathy to
            help and strive for a better life and not limiting herself to the
            contemporary world of she's just a girl and as such, she shouldn’t be
            useful. She made me realize that as a woman, we are smarter and
            stronger than we think and that everyone deserves education and
            awareness. She made me realize that you don’t have to accept the
            society view about yourself. Her life story really inspired me and
            how far she has come
