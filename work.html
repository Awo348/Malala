          Malala Yousafzai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for
          the right of every child to receive an education. She was born in the
          Swat Valley in Pakistan. When the Islamic Taliban movement took
          control of the valley in 2008, girls’ schools were burned down. Malala
          kept a diary of the events, which was published in 2009 by BBC Urdu.
          In her diary she spoke out against the Taliban’s terrorist regime. An
          American documentary film made Malala internationally famous.

          It was not long before the Taliban threatened her life. In 2012,
          Malala was shot in the head on a school bus by a Taliban gunman. She
          survived, but had to flee to England and live in exile there because a
          fatwa was issued against her.
        </p>

        <p class="salsa">
          In 2013, TIME magazine named Malala one of
          <span class="brown"
            >“The 100 Most Influential People in the World.”</span
          >
          On her 16th birthday she spoke in the United Nations. In her speech
          Malala called for the equal right to education for girls all over the
          world, and became a symbol of this cause.
