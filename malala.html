            <h1 class="">Details about Malala Yousafzai</h1>

            <p class="">
              Malala Yousafzai was born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, the
              largest city in the Swat Valley in what is now the Khyber
              Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. She is the daughter of Ziauddin
              and Tor Pekai Yousafzai and has two younger brothers.
            </p>

            <p class="">
              At a very young age, Malala developed a thirst for knowledge. For
              years her father, a passionate education advocate himself, ran a
              learning institution in the city, and school was a big part of
              Malala’s family. She later wrote that her father told her stories
              about how she would toddle into classes even before she could talk
              and acted as if she were the teacher
            </p>

            <p class="">
              In 2007, when Malala was ten years old, the situation in the Swat
              Valley rapidly changed for her family and community. The Taliban
              began to control the Swat Valley and quickly became the dominant
              socio-political force throughout much of northwestern Pakistan.
              Girls were banned from attending school, and cultural activities
              like dancing and watching television were prohibited. Suicide
              attacks were widespread, and the group made its opposition to a
              proper education for girls a cornerstone of its terror campaign.
              By the end of 2008, the Taliban had destroyed some 400 schools.
            </p>

            <p class="">
              Determined to go to school and with a firm belief in her right to
              an education, Malala stood up to the Taliban. Alongside her
              father, Malala quickly became a critic of their tactics. “How dare
              the Taliban take away my basic right to education?” she once said
              on Pakistani TV.
            </p>

            <p class="">
              In early 2009, Malala started to blog anonymously on the Urdu
              language site of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). She
              wrote about life in the Swat Valley under Taliban rule, and about
              her desire to go to school. Using the name “Gul Makai,” she
              described being forced to stay at home, and she questioned the
              motives of the Taliban.

            <!-- <h1 class="italic">Contd...</h1> -->

            <p class="">
              Malala was 11 years old when she wrote her first BBC diary entry.
              Under the blog heading “I am afraid,” she described her fear of a
              full-blown war in her beautiful Swat Valley, and her nightmares
              about being afraid to go to school because of the Taliban.
            </p>

            <p class="">
              Pakistan’s war with the Taliban was fast approaching, and on May
              5, 2009, Malala became an internally displaced person (IDP), after
              having been forced to leave her home and seek safety hundreds of
              miles away.
            </p>

            <p class="">
              On her return, after weeks of being away from Swat, Malala once
              again used the media and continued her public campaign for her
              right to go to school. Her voice grew louder, and over the course
              of the next three years, she and her father became known
              throughout Pakistan for their determination to give Pakistani
              girls access to a free quality education. Her activism resulted in
              a nomination for the International Children’s Peace Prize in 2011.
              That same year, she was awarded Pakistan’s National Youth Peace
              Prize. But, not everyone supported and welcomed her campaign to
              bring about change in Swat. On the morning of October 9, 2012,
              15-year-old Malala Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban.
            </p>

            <p class="">
              Seated on a bus heading home from school, Malala was talking with
              her friends about schoolwork. Two members of the Taliban stopped
              the bus. A young bearded Talib asked for Malala by name, and fired
              three shots at her. One of the bullets entered and exited her head
              and lodged in her shoulder. Malala was seriously wounded. That
              same day, she was airlifted to a Pakistani military hospital in
              Peshawar and four days later to an intensive care unit in
              Birmingham, England.

              <p class="">
                Once she was in the United Kingdom, Malala was taken out of a
                medically induced coma. Though she would require multiple
                surgeries, including repair of a facial nerve to fix the
                paralyzed left side of her face, she had suffered no major brain
                damage. In March 2013, after weeks of treatment and therapy,
                Malala was able to begin attending school in Birmingham.
              </p>

              <p class="">
                After the shooting, her incredible recovery and return to school
                resulted in a global outpouring of support for Malala. On July
                12, 2013, her 16th birthday, Malala visited New York and spoke
                at the United Nations. Later that year, she published her first
                book, an autobiography entitled “I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood
                Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.” On October 10,
                2013, in acknowledgement of her work, the European Parliament
                awarded Malala the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of
                Thought.
              </p>

              <p class="">
                In 2014, through the Malala Fund, the organization she
                co-founded with her father, Malala traveled to Jordan to meet
                Syrian refugees, to Kenya to meet young female students, and
                finally to northern Nigeria for her 17th birthday. In Nigeria,
                she spoke out in support of the abducted girls who were
                kidnapped earlier that year by Boko Haram, a terrorist group
                which, like the Taliban, tries to stop girls from going to
                school.

            <div class="final-flex">
              <p class="">
                In October 2014, Malala, along with Indian children’s rights
                activist Kailash Satyarthi, was named a Nobel Peace Prize
                winner. At age 17, she became the youngest person to receive
                this prize. Accepting the award, Malala reaffirmed that “This
                award is not just for me. It is for those forgotten children who
                want education. It is for those frightened children who want
                peace. It is for those voiceless children who want change.”
              </p>

              <p class="">
                Today, the Malala Fund has become an organization that, through
                education, empowers girls to achieve their potential and become
                confident and strong leaders in their own countries. Funding
                education projects in six countries and working with
                international leaders, the Malala Fund joins with local partners
                to invest in innovative solutions on the ground and advocates
                globally for quality secondary education for all girls.
              </p>

              <p class="">
                Currently residing in Birmingham, Malala is an active proponent
                of education as a fundamental social and economic right. Through
                the Malala Fund and with her own voice, Malala Yousafzai remains
                a staunch advocate for the power of education and for girls to
                become agents of change in their communities.
